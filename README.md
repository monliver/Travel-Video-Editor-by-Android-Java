1. What was the problem?
In today's fast-paced social media landscape, users crave the ability to share moments that are visually appealing and
contextually rich. However, editing videos to incorporate location details is tedious and time-consuming. This cumbersome
process often deters users from fully showcasing the depth of their experiences, leading to less engaging content.

2. What was the team trying to accomplish?
The team aimed to create an intuitive, fast, and engaging mobile application that enables users to effortlessly produce and
share contextually rich travel videos on Instagram. By automating the extraction of location data and integrating seamless map
animations, the team sought to eliminate the complexity of video editing, allowing users to quickly showcase their travel
experiences in a visually appealing way. The ultimate goal was to enhance user engagement on social media by making the
video creation process as streamlined and enjoyable as possible.

3. High Level Design
GeoClip Editor is designed as an Android application that integrates video processing, map animation generation, and
seamless sharing with Instagram. The high-level architecture is divided into three main components: the user interface (UI),
the processing engine, and data management. The UI is responsible for user interactions, video selection, and customization
options. The processing engine handles the extraction of video metadata, generation of dynamic map animations, and splicing
of videos into a single cohesive clip. Data management is implemented locally on the device, ensuring quick access to video
files and maintaining user privacy.
